= Connecting Kabanero to GitHub with Tekton Webhooks

A webhook is an outbound HTTP request that helps you create a relationship between your GitHub repository and a particular URL, in this case a link:https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-pipelines/tree/Readme-updates#kabanero-pipelines[Tekton pipeline]. After you configure the webhook, changes you make in your GitHub repository will trigger the Tekton pipeline and its associated tasks.

== Prerequisites

* A GitHub repository
* link:https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-foundation/tree/master/scripts[Kabanero Foundation] or Kabanero Enterprise.
+
Your Kabanero installation includes an instance of  the link:https://github.com/tektoncd/dashboard#installing-the-latest-release[Tekton Dashboard] with the link:https://github.com/tektoncd/experimental/blob/master/webhooks-extension/docs/InstallReleaseBuild.md[Webhooks Extension] installed.

=== Create a persistent volume
Tekton pipelines need a persistent volume. If there is no network storage available, create a `hostPath pv`. For more information, see link:https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-pipelines/tree/Readme-updates#create-a-persistent-volume[Creating a persistent volume].

=== Generate a GitHub access token.
You need to generate a GitHub personal access token to use for creating the webhook and for accessing the repository source code during PipelineRuns. To generate the token:

* Go to link:https://github.com/settings/tokens[github.com/settings/tokens] and click `Generate new token`.
* Check the `admin:repo_hook` option and click `Generate token`. If you are working in a private repository, additional options may be required. Check with your administrator for details.
* Make sure to save the token to a file since you can't see it after you leave this page.

=== Create secrets.
If you are working with a private or enterprise GitHub repository, you need to store your access token in a Kubernetes secret. From your Tekton Dashboard, select `Secrets` from the sidebar menu and click `Add Secret`. Use your GitHub user name and the personal access token you generated in the previous step to create this secret. Select the service account that is used by the pipeline you want to trigger. In this case, use `kabanero-operator`.

If you want to push the image to Docker Hub, you need to create a separate secret to connect to Docker Hub. Follow the same procedure but use your Docker Hub user name and password to create this secret.

== Create a webhook.
* From your Tekton Dashboard, select `webhooks` from the sidebar menu and click
`Add Webhook`.
* Enter your information in the `Create Webhook` window.
+
** **Name**
+
Give your webhook a distinctive name.
** **Repository URL**
+
The URL of the GitHub repository that you want to connect to Kabanero.
** **Access token**
+
Use this field to create a secret to store your GitHub personal access token. Even if you already created a token-based Git secret from your Tekton Dashboard, you must also store your GitHub personal access token in this field. Click the green plus icon beside the field to open the `Create Access Token Secret` window.
+
Give your access token secret a descriptive name. In the `Access token` field, enter the GitHub personal access token that you previously generated in the <<Generate a GitHub access token.>> step.
** **Namespace**
+
Select the Kubernetes namespace in which you want to run your pipeline. In this case, choose `kabanero`.
** **Pipeline**
+
Select the Pipeline in your target Namespace. PipelineRuns (and their accompanying PipelineResources) are created in this namespace. For information about how to create and configure pipelines, see link:https://github.com/kabanero-io/kabanero-pipelines/tree/Readme-updates#kabanero-pipelines[Kabanero Pipelines].
** **Service Account**
+
This field specifies the service account that is used by the PipelineRun. In this case, choose `kabanero operator`.
** **Docker registry**
+
Select the Docker registry where any built images are pushed. Use the same Docker registry that you created a secret for previously. For Docker Hub, use `index.docker.io/<docker_id>`. For an internal registry, use `docker-registry.default.svc:5000/kabanero`. If the namespace that is associated with your internal registry is not `kabanero`, use  `docker-registry.default.svc:5000/your-namespace`.
* After you complete the necessary information, click `Create`.

== Confirm your webhook.

* Look for the webhook in your GitHub Repository.
+
From your GitHub repository, go to the `settings` tab and select `Webhooks` from the sidebar menu. Look for the webhook you created. Sometimes the webhook initially shows a 504 error icon but after the webhook is used it changes to a green check mark.
* Update code and merge a PR.
+
Make any update to your code, create a PR, and merge it. This change kicks off a PipelineRun.
* Check the PipelineRun from your Tekton Dashboard.
+
From your Tekton Dashboard, select `PipelineRuns` from the sidebar menu. Look for the PipelineRun you just kicked off.

Nice work! You connected your GitHub repo to Kabanero with a webhook. Changes in your code can now automatically trigger tasks that are specified by the pipeline.
